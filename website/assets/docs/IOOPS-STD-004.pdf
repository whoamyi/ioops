1. CONTINUITY FRAMEWORK

This protocol establishes guidelines for maintaining operational continuity and ensuring protocol adherence during transitional periods, disruptions, and emergency situations.

1.1 Objectives
• Ensure uninterrupted operational capability
• Maintain protocol compliance during disruptions
• Enable rapid recovery from incidents
• Preserve coordination effectiveness

1.2 Scope
Applies to all IOOPS-coordinated operations including:
• Transit operations
• Coordination functions
• Verification activities
• Documentation systems
• Communication networks

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

2. RISK ASSESSMENT

2.1 Continuity Threats
Systematic identification of potential continuity threats:
• System failures
• Communication disruptions
• Jurisdictional changes
• Natural events
• Security incidents
• Resource constraints

2.2 Impact Analysis
Assessment of potential impact on:
• Operational capability
• Protocol compliance
• Coordination effectiveness
• Documentation integrity
• Stakeholder confidence

2.3 Probability Evaluation
Classification of threat probability:
• High: Likely within 12 months
• Medium: Possible within 24 months
• Low: Unlikely within 36 months

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

3. CONTINUITY PLANNING

3.1 Continuity Requirements
Operational entities must establish:
• Alternative operational procedures
• Backup communication channels
• Redundant documentation systems
• Emergency coordination protocols
• Recovery time objectives

3.2 Critical Functions
Identification and prioritization of critical functions:

Priority 1 (Immediate Recovery Required):
• Safety-critical operations
• Emergency coordination
• Essential communications

Priority 2 (Recovery Within 24 Hours):
• Standard transit operations
• Routine coordination
• Documentation systems

Priority 3 (Recovery Within 72 Hours):
• Administrative functions
• Training activities
• Non-essential reporting

3.3 Resource Requirements
Documentation of resources necessary for continuity:
• Personnel (minimum staffing levels)
• Systems (backup capabilities)
• Facilities (alternative locations)
• Communications (redundant channels)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

4. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

4.1 Activation Triggers
Continuity plan activation occurs when:
• Normal operations cannot continue
• Critical systems are unavailable
• Coordination capabilities are compromised
• Protocol compliance is at risk

4.2 Notification Procedures
Immediate notification to:
• IOOPS Regional Coordination Office
• Affected operational entities
• Relevant jurisdictional authorities
• Coordinating partners

4.3 Emergency Operations
Transition to emergency operational mode:
• Activate backup systems
• Implement alternative procedures
• Establish emergency coordination
• Maintain essential documentation
• Ensure ongoing protocol compliance

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

5. RECOVERY PROTOCOLS

5.1 Recovery Phases

Phase 1: Immediate Response (0-4 hours)
• Assess situation
• Activate continuity plan
• Establish emergency operations
• Notify stakeholders

Phase 2: Short-term Recovery (4-24 hours)
• Stabilize operations
• Restore critical functions
• Implement temporary measures
• Maintain coordination

Phase 3: Interim Operations (1-7 days)
• Restore priority 2 functions
• Assess damage/impact
• Plan full recovery
• Continue temporary operations

Phase 4: Full Recovery (7+ days)
• Restore all functions
• Return to normal operations
• Document lessons learned
• Update continuity plans

5.2 Recovery Priorities
Systematic restoration based on criticality assessment and operational requirements.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

6. TESTING AND VALIDATION

6.1 Testing Requirements
Regular testing of continuity capabilities:
• Desktop exercises: Quarterly
• Functional tests: Semi-annually
• Full-scale exercises: Annually

6.2 Test Scenarios
Realistic scenarios addressing:
• System failures
• Communication disruptions
• Personnel unavailability
• Facility inaccessibility
• Multi-jurisdictional complications

6.3 Validation Criteria
Successful validation demonstrates:
• Continuity plan effectiveness
• Recovery time objectives met
• Protocol compliance maintained
• Coordination capability preserved
• Documentation integrity ensured

6.4 Continuous Improvement
Test results inform:
• Plan updates
• Procedure refinements
• Resource adjustments
• Training enhancements
